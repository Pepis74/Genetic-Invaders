This is an android game I spent a year developing back in 2019-2020. It teaches the player concepts of genetics like DNA transcription through innovative and fun arcade-like gameplay. It allows player customization, giving the option to choose between aptly themed passives, guns and skins that can be obtained from loot boxes and daily missions.

In this repository, you will find the apk and all the assets in the folder GI Assets. This game was made in Unity 2019.2.1f1. In order to get access to the project, just make a new unity project in that unity version, configure the project to be an Android game and drag drop these assets in the project folder.

A trailer for the game can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/rmM-3FvxsbU?si=2TashqwyCalnjqNI

Sadly, the game is no longer available in the Play Store.
